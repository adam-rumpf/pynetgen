An implementation of the NETGEN network flows problem instance generator.

The command line arguments for the NETGEN script are as follows (in order):

    nodes -- number of nodes (default 10)
    sources -- number of source nodes (default 3)

    tsinks -- number of transshipment sinks (default 0)
    hicost -- percent of skeleton arcs (0-100) given maximum cost (default 0)

    mincap -- minimum arc capacity (default 100)
    maxcap -- maximum arc capacity (default 1000)

NETGEN is a standard network flows problem instance generator defined in:

    D. Klingman, A. Napier, and J. Stutz. NETGEN: A Program for generating
    large scale capacitated assignment, transportation, and minimum cost flow
    network problems. Management Science, 20(5):814-821, 1974.
    doi:10.1287/mnsc.20.5.814.

With the exception of the final "rng" argument and the optional file tag, the
command line arguments of this script are identical to those of the original C
implementation.

By default the resulting problem instance is a minimum-cost flow problem.
Transportation and maximum flow problems can also be generated, and are
implicitly chosen according to the network parameters.

The resulting problem instance is a transportation problem if the total number
of sources and sinks equals the total number of nodes, and if there are no
transshipment sources or sinks. It is a maximum flow problem if it is not an
assignment problem and the min/max costs are both set to 1.

Skeleton arcs are part of NETGEN's process for generated minimum-cost flow
problems, and are included to ensure feasibility. They are a subset of arcs
that include paths from sources to sinks, and they are uncapacitated in order
to ensure that the network can carry sufficient flow, but a fraction of them
are chosen to receive the maximum possible cost in order to discourage
uninteresting solutions that use only the skeleton arcs.
"""
grid_instructions = """
usage: pynetgen.py [-f [FILE]] grid [ARGS ...]

A grid-based network flows problem instance generator.

The command line arguments for the grid-based method are as follows (in order):
    seed -- random number generator seed (default 1; -1 for random)
    nodes -- number of nodes (default 10)
    rows -- number of grid rows (default 3)
    columns -- number of grid columns (default 4)
    diagonal -- whether to include diagonal arcs (default 1)
    reverse -- whether to include arcs in the reverse direction (default 1)
    wrap -- whether to wrap the row adjacencies like a cylinder (default 0)
    mincost -- minimum arc cost (default 10)

    supply -- total supply at the master supply node (default 1000)
    hicost -- percent of skeleton arcs (0-100) given maximum cost (default 0)
    capacitated -- percent of arcs (0-100) that are capacitated (default 100)
    mincap -- minimum arc capacity (default 100)
    maxcap -- maximum arc capacity (default 1000)
    rng -- index of random network generator to use (default 0), including:
        0: the original NETGEN pseudorandom number generator
        1: the Python standard library random number generator

This is a simple network flows problem instance generator that uses a
grid-based network. The network consists of a square grid of nodes, with a
master source on one side feeding into all rows, and a master sink on the other
side extracting from all rows.

By default the resulting problem instance is a minimum-cost flow problem. A
maximum flow problem is generated if the minimum and maximum arc costs are both
set equal to 1. Transshipment sources and sinks are not included, and
transportation problems cannot be generated.

The master source is located on the West side while the master sink is located
on the East side. All transshipment arcs feed into their immediate neighbors to
the North, East, and South (within the boundaries of the grid). If the
"diagonal" argument is True then they also feed into their neighbors to the
Northeast and Southeast. If the "reverse" argument is True then they also feed
into the Western directions. If the "wrap" argument is True then the first row
is considered to be adjacent to the last row.

Skeleton arcs are included in minimum-cost flow problems in order to ensure
feasibility. All arcs in the first row are treated as skeleton arcs, which are
uncapacitated to ensure that the network can carry enough flow, but a fraction
of them are chosen to receive the maximum possible cost in order to discourage
uninteresting solutions that use only the skeleton arcs.

    with one master source that acts as a predecessor to every node in the
    first column and one master sink that acts as a successor to every node in
    the last column.
    
    In all cases an arc is generated from each transshipment node to the nodes
